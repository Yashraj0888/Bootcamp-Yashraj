            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This project consists of three different web pages with unique layouts, ranging from simple content presentation to navigation-based layouts. Below are the details of each page, along with the challenges I encountered and my thought process for developing them.</p>

            <h2>Page Links</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="solution-1.html">Solution 1 - My First Webpage</a></li>
                <li><a href="solution-2.html">Solution 2 - Golden Layout Webpage</a></li>
                <li><a href="solution-3.html">Solution 3 - Enhanced Golden Layout Webpage</a></li>

            <h2>Thought Process</h2>
            <p>The goal of this project was to explore and implement different HTML structures with varying complexity. Hereâ€™s a summary of my thought process:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Solution 1</strong> - This page was the simplest, containing an ordered list for movies and an unordered list for books. I also included an image on the side for additional visual interest. The goal was to create a basic webpage layout with clear content separation.</li>
                <li><strong>Solution 2</strong> - The challenge here was introducing multiple navigation bars (left and right) to make the layout more complex. The floating navigation bars required attention to spacing and positioning. I used inline CSS for this solution, but realized that for larger projects, a separate CSS file would be more manageable.</li>
                <li><strong>Solution 3</strong> - This page built on Solution 2 by adding detailed content and descriptions for the movies, books, and items in the table. I also included an 'About' and 'Contact' section to provide more context to the user. The main challenge was ensuring all sections were well-organized and readable, especially with multiple navigation bars.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
            <p>Throughout the development process, I encountered the following challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Aligning the navigation bars (left and right) properly without CSS frameworks required some trial and error with float properties.</li>
                <li>Ensuring the page content was properly spaced and readable with the added complexity of multiple sections.</li>
                <li>Adding detailed content while maintaining a clean, easy-to-read layout, especially in the movie and book lists.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>GPT Chat Reference</h2>
            <p>For future reference, the following GPT Chat conversations were crucial in solving some of the issues I faced during the development process:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://chat.openai.com/">OpenAI Chat</a> - For general guidance and answering specific HTML/CSS questions.</li>
            </ul>
